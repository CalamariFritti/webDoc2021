Founded in 2015 by two enthusiasts for aquatic plants our company is currently producing high quality water plants for use in fish tanks, ponds, zoos and many moe locations. We focus on plants growing comletetly under the surface (submers as in submersible), as well as plants that grow "with wet feet", i.e. roots and rhizoma are under water with leaves and flowers growing on or above surface level (emers). Our mission ist to provide a wide variety of high quality, healthy plants, that help others shape their water eco-systems to their needs and liking. Our specail focus lies on fast growing, completely clean plants, able to be intrdouced in the highest possible variety of settings. With clean plants, we mean to provide the advertised oragnisms only, so no "surprise vistiors" (such as snails, funghi parts of other plants) can enter our customers eco-systems via our plants. Of course all of our plants are free of pesticide, funghicides or all other types of potential poisonous substances and are delivered within minimal time to ensure maximum potentail for growth.

Currently we are employing only two people:

Franz is responsible for growth, breeding and cross-breeding of plants, as well as managing of packaging and shipping.

Karoline is responsible for office work, such as, but not limited to: orders and customer contact, marketing and social media management.
