
The front page should only show the video attached as well as a 'tiles-style' grid of links to the subpages. 
(The video was suppossed to be a representative video of nice waterplants. I just now realised that quality and photography of the video are ... mediocre. Apparently I am missing the equipment (and probably  also the skill(s)) to get a better result, so we have to use this one.)

Just a short welcoming heading for text:

*text begin*

<heading> Herzlich Willkommen in der Welt der Unterwasserpflazen </heading> 

Die Submers Emers GmbH begrüßt Sie im Cottbuser Atalantis.

<video>

<lots of links to subpages>

*text end*
